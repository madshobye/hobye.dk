				<h4>Experiastudio.com (December 2010)</h4>
			



			<p style="font-style:italic;">I organized a three-day Hack-A-Thon at illutron, inviting programmers of all levels to show that a device could go further and accomplish more than the task it was designed for. In their hands, mobile devices steered boats, powered secret messages that flashed from the backs of moving bikes, and triggered flame cannons in the pursuit of night time photography. Boundaries were broken and eyebrows singed. For science.</p>
				
			<div property="sioc:content"><p>#The self operational system
The self operational system is a autonomous boat that can navigate the Copenhagen harbor by itself. It uses two old motors from battery driven drills as propellers for steering and propulsion. The controller is a Xperia play phone with GPS, 3G and compass to navigate.</p>
<p>The system was completed in three days to explore the possibilities of the Xperia phones and work the intuitively wrong concept of the combination of phones and water. On the final day the challenge was to prove that it was possible for the boat to sail from the Teglholmen to the south-harbor without interference or control from our hand. Once the way points was placed the boat was left to navigate on its own, while we were following its position over the internet. Although it came frighteningly close to crashing on the rocks, it managed to make the trip and landed right in the arms of its creator who was waiting at the docking station.</p>

<p>#Find my twin
We designed two identical boxes with a little lens that was a window into a virtual compass. The needle always points to the other box. Each box had a compartment which was locked with a combination lock. The combination was written on the other box. This meant that you would only be able to discover what was in the boxes by searching for its twin.</p>
<p>This project was a part of a larger exploration with Xperia Studio. We want to convey the message to the world that technology should be designed for remixing, hacking and by its users. The process was filmed, and will published as part of a larger promotion about the phones.</p>

<h1 id="scraper-bike">Scraper bike</h1>
<p>With inspiration from the scraper bike culture we wanted to design a pimped out version that would function during the night time as well.</p>
<p>The scraper bike culture is defined in the urban dictionary as:
“A new trend that is a part of the San Francisco Bay Area Hyphy Movement in which people ride their tricked out bikes and go stupid, dumb, retarded while on their bikes. Generally, the bikes have nice designs, such as duo-tone paint jobs, and rims or spinners. The term was coined by the rap group Trunk Boiz of Oakland, California.”</p>
<p>Besides “pimping” an old rusty bike up in colors and patterns, we used the concept of persistence of vision to light it up in the street at night. Persistence of vision enabled us to write out text and pictures as the bike moved through the streets of Copenhagen. The lights were controlled by an Arduino ADK board and a Xperia phone mounted on the handle was used as an interface to control the different patterns and colors.</p>
<p>This project was a part of a larger exploration with Xperia Studio. We want to convey the message to the world that technology should be designed to be remixed, hacked and customized by its users. The process was filmed, and will published as part of a larger promotion about the phones.</p>
