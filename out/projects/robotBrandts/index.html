				<h4>Kunsthallen Brandts Odense (August 2009)</h4>
			



			<p style="font-style:italic;">N7331227 is an old industrial robot which has originally been used to grind toilet seats. It was given a new life and a new home at the art museum Kunsthallen Brandts in Odense from August 21th to November 29th 2009.</p>

<p>N7331227 is the serial number of the old industrial robot used. The robot had, for many years, been used as an industrial toilet seat grinder. Compared to the standards of modern robot technology, it had become outdated. It did not have the dynamic and flexible joints expected of a modern robot and the internal computer was only able to navigate a set of fixed points. This became apparent in its aesthetic appearance, as its movements would be rather rigid and squeaking noises were heard every time it moved.</p>
<p>Since its old job of creating identical toilet seats was rather repetitive, we decided to put the old robot into retirement and enable it to have a life of its own as a retired robot. We did this conceptually by programming a set of moods into the system. It would either try to replicate drawings others would draw on paper or it would try to engage with participants by observing them as they passed through the exhibitions and as they observed the robot as well. When no one was around, it would look for people until somebody came in and caught its attention.</p>
