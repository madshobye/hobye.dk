			<div property="sioc:content"><p>Excerpt from the book:</p>
<p>Half Machine (now illutron) presented a work called The Singing Plant that gave a new perspective to the classical opposites of Nature and culture. The Singing Plant was installed at DGI-Byen, and visitors were encouraged to interact with a living plant in an untraditional way. By using advanced computer technology, the plant was programmed to react to touch and gave feedback in the form of sound and light. The harder the plant was touched, the louder the sound and more intense was the light that it emitted. The Singing Plant was totally dependent on visitor interaction in order to function as a work. The reaction the work got became an important part of its significance. From the video documentation on Half Machine&#39;s website, it is clear that the plant&#39;s ability to communicate through light and sound strengthened the visitor&#39;s view of the plant as a living being. The work&#39;s interactive and performance elements were essential for the creation of it, and the installation questioned the conventional perception of the relation between man, Nature and technology. The work and the response it evoked, demonstrated how easy it is to change our perceptions. Another perspective on the same theme could be experienced at Roskilde Festival 2008. HaIf Machine, again in collaboration with the 8-bit Club, created a site-specific work about the way the visitors interact with each other when at a music festival. The installation was called Explosion Village, and was a combination of recycled materials, retro-technological aesthetics and computer technology. At the festival, the collective created a 12-meter high steel construction that could be seen from far away. In the area around the tower, they spread out 25 large white plastic containers. The work encouraged the passers-by to drum on.</p>
