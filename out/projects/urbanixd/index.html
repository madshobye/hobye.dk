			<p style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Aural fixations at the City | Data | Future exhibition. It presents a series of visions depicting what it might be like to live in a near future city saturated with data. Each piece will question what this might mean for our changing relationship with the city and its citizens.</p>
				
			<div property="sioc:content"><p>What might it mean to live in a city where everything is measured, and crowdsourced opinion holds sway? How might this affect our own judgment in the face of such quantification and what does this mean for the creation and consumption of personal data?
Will the city of the future protect us or will it monitor us? Will it provide shelter so that we can decide with whom we share our most intimate thoughts? As we reflect on the value we place on data, what new rituals might emerge around our need to share?</p>
<p>##Arual fixations</p>

<p>Privacy amongst residents is maintained through the rare art of conversation. An analogue form of data that cannot be detected or processed by the smart city’s digital sensors. Friends and families share their personal thoughts within the closed walls of intimate spaces. Their own homes, friend’s lounge room, a favourite café. These thoughts, dreams, and aspirations for a better future are unheard by the smart city. The bricks and mortar of the city are the caretakers of these citizens. Watching over them as they meet to converse. Capturing the stories exchanged within its walls. Aural prints of words unheard.</p>

<p>A young voyeur lives in the city during these times. Each day and night she roams the streets peering into the windows of these intimate spaces to see how people live their lives, hoping to catch glimpses of the stories they might share. She senses that the city is full of lost and unheard aspirations. In a local flea market she buys an old military communication device and extends its listening capabilities to tune into the frequencies of aural prints. Wearing the device she is able to virtually travel to all corners of the city and eavesdrop on lost fragments embedded in its walls. She makes it her mission to collect these unheard hopes of the citizens.</p>
