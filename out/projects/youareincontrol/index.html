				<h4>You are in control (November 2012)</h4>
			



			<p style="font-style:italic;">What happens when a community of creative people take over a 50-year-old barge and decide to use it to build large-scale interactive installations? illutron is a collaborative interactive art studio located on Copenhagen’s south harbor. Its members are artists, designers, performers, programmers, electricians, musicians and electronics wizards. The group started with two primary values: to create a community around the creative artistic usage of technology, and to build an open platform where individuals could explore their own curiosity. Founding Illutron member and interactive designer Mads Høbye will talk about how the studio was founded, some of their remarkable installations and the intertwined social, technical and artistic processes encapsulate its community.</p>
				
			<div property="sioc:content"><p>Between November 4-6 2012, Reykjavik hosted the 5th edition of You Are In Control, a hothouse for creatives and thinkers interested in cross-platform explorations and ideas relating to future business models created by the digital revolution.</p>

<p>Throwing the ‘Net as wide open as possible, the conference touches on all aspects of the creative industries, from food, digital, literature, design, music, film, games and business, to look at some of the most current trends, exciting overlaps and pressing problems.</p>

(I used a picture of Christian in his floating bathtub as an example of the free thinking spirit.)</p>
<p>Part conference, part creative retreat, YAIC 2012 will take place in the cutting edge confines of Kaldalón in Harpa, Reykjavik’s newest arts space and an architectural phenomenon in its own right.</p>
<p>I had the honor to present my work as a member of Illutron:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mads Høbye is part of a project called Illutron, a community of creative people who have taken over a 50-year-old barge on Copenhagen’s south harbour and used it to build large-scale interactive installations.</p>
<p>Mads described how the project’s members are a chaotic mix of artists, designers, performers, programmers, electricians, musicians and electronics wizards.</p>
<p>The group started with two primary values: to create a community around the creative artistic usage of technology, and to build an open platform where individuals could explore their own curiosity.</p>
