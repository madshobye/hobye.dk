I participated as a part of the exhibition with my [Touchbox](http://hobye.dk:9778/projects/touchbox.html) - You can find the article [here](http://hobye.dk:9778/publications/CHI2012TouchBox.html). Jonas Löwgren, my supervisor, did a good job describing the trip from his point of view and how he sees CHI as one who has been a part of it from the beginning. You can read his report [here](http://medea.mah.se/2012/05/malmo-point-of-view-chi-is-coming-around/). I took the time to document both the CHI conference, the exhibition and a little part of Texas. You can find the pictures [here](https://plus.google.com/photos/108283711574096278336/albums/5742441849334379553?authkey=CPqG54njut_u_gE).

Of the many inspirational talks I would like to mention one here. It was the talk of Gaver about what to expect of research through design. You can find the paper [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208538&preflayout=tabs). At the exhibition the [Touché Sensing](http://www.disneyresearch.com/research/projects/hci_touche_drp.htm) was the most interesting piece (from a technology point of view). It was clear that the possibilities within touch and intimate touch interaction could be expanded with this technology. Right after the conference I asked DZL if we could build a version for Arduino. He managed to do it and you can read about it [here](http://hobye.dk:9778/blurbs/instructableTouch.html).

Ohh and one last thing if you ever go to Marfa do not miss The Museum of electronic wonders! It is the most amazing collection of 60's and 70's devices. See below:
