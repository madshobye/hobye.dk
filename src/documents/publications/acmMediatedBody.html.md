abstract: 'This work addresses Mediated Body, a design study in the field of embodied interaction. Briefly, the Mediated Body entails a Suit worn by a Performer engaging in social play with a Participant. The Performer and the Participant each wear a pair of headphones, and when they touch each othersâ€™ bare skin, they both hear a complex sound pattern.The interaction takes place in a public place in full view of bystanders and spectators, who play the socially significant role of the Audience in the use situation.'
