abstract: 'Smootbooth is an experimental social photo platform. It has been used over 100 times in all kinds of settings. From conferences for large scale companies to subversive and playful underground events where people dress up in outrageous costumes. The key element in the booth is the possibility for the participants to take the pictures themselves. This leaves out the photographer and enables the participants to use the space as an excuse for social interaction. Multiple modules exists: Green screen, Facebook upload, direct print etc.'
