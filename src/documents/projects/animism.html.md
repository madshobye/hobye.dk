abstract: 'What is it that makes us emotionally attached to technology and how can we design this? At Roskilde University I did a two week workshop with first year students on the potential of designing for anthropomorphism and animism. Multiple interactive robots and abstract installations were build. They all invited the user to start making interpretation on the personalities of the installations.'

A few experiments from a workshop taught by me about anthropomorphism and animism at Humtek RUC

> Anthropomorphizing is a natural human tendency, thought to be the result of a perceptual system designed to find order in a complex world.

> Anthropomorphism is a category error, some argue: the treatment of an entity (an animal) as a member of a class (things with minds) to which it does not belong; or the comparison of that entity to one (such as a human) belonging in a different category.

> ("Anthropomorphism" entry in the Encyclopedia of Human-Animal Relationships, Horowitz A., 2007)
