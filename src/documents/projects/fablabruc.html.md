abstract: 'Fablab RUC is an experimental research lab focused on maker culture and empowering academia to use rapid prototyping in materials as a basis for conversations with the real world. Students, researchers and the public are free to use it to build based on their own curiosity. I have been employed since April 2014, part time, as a supervisor on interaction design projects and to develop maker culture as a part of an academic environment. All of the employed people are members of illutron.'

The lab has grown to be one of the largest Fablabs in Denmark. I has four large scale laser cutters (one for metal), 20 3D printers, 3 CNC machines, a huge inventory of electronics and many more smaller rapid prototyping tools. Multiple papers has been written about the lab and can be found under [publications](/publications).
