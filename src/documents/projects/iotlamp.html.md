abstract: 'As a part of a electricity usage visualization project with inudgeyou.com, I developed multiple prototypes. One such prototype is an internet enabled lamp (internet of things). The lamp uses a NodeMCU control board and neopixels. It can be programmed to change color depending of the electricity usage through the internet via Wifi. To aesthetically deviate from the usual laser cut acrylic, often found in Fablabs, he made a shield out of metal. The shield was cut on the Fablabs new metal laser cutter.  '

For the MCU we used the [ESP/Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino upload) and the [NeoPixelBus](https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus/tree/NeoPixelAnimator).
