Bits & Beers is an atypical conference connecting businesses, creatives, entrepreneurs, and makers in the relaxed
Friday bar atmosphere, with the structure of a well organized business event.

Main takeaways:
* Always explore the situated.
* Bring the lab to the field.
* Tweak on the fly.
* Interactive elements will be abused.
* You can guide the interaction.
* Embrace the unexpected.
