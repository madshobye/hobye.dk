abstract: 'Electrolumen consists of a telephone pole, only two meters tall, with four street lamps mounted right above head height. Four wires looking exactly like standard aerial high voltage electrical cable are mounted on real ceramic insulators and go off at chest height to another telephone pole several meters away.'

*Electrolumen is a telegraph post with four lamps. If you grab two of the lamps with your hands, the electric current will travel through your body, and the lamps will turn on and start generating sound.*

Electrolumen looked like an authentic lamppost. It had four street lights mounted at the top and three electrical wires (spanning four metres) attached to another lamppost. The only difference between it and a real lamppost was that it was only two metres tall, effectively bringing the electricity hanging above the streets down to a level where everyone could touch it. This created an alternative interface that played with the danger of touching high-voltage electricity components.

Instead of the participants being electrocuted when touching the lamps and the wires, they could modulate a soundscape in real time; the lamps would light up to augment their actions and create an intimate atmosphere of standing beneath a blinking lamppost.

The lamps and the wires required two points of touch to react. To light up a lamp, one had to touch another lamp as well. This could be by direct touch, but to get all the lamps to light up required four touch points and therefore required collaboration between at least two participants, thereby inviting participants to collaborate.

Electrolumen encourages people to make contact with each other. In order to light all the four lamps and to play with different sound ambiences, you need extra hands to help you. You can also send the current through your friend or for example form human chains. There are no instructions how to use the installation, the participants will have to figure it out themselves, be creative and play with it.
