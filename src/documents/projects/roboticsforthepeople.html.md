abstract: 'Robot technology has been reserved for the industry since the 70Â´s. At Fablab RUC we have been working on changing that. WE have build a industrial robot arm that cost a fraction of what a normal arm cost. This allows people to build it themselves and it gives people the freedom to experiment with it. It costs less than 1000 dollars, thus enabling small local productions to use robots in their processes without breaking the bank. It is a product of a 3 day sprint.'
