abstract: 'The megaphone project consists of two megaphones, the microphone of one megaphone is connected to the speaker of the other. When you talk in one megaphone your voice comes out of the other, creating an odd feedback loop between two participants representing each others voices.'

The installation invited people to play with the possibility of representing another person's voice. The only catch was the other person would also be able to represent your own voice. This created a potentially playful situation where each person should choose their words carefully because the other could return the words just as easily.
