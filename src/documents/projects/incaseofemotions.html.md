During the Music2Go concert on May 5, 2013 the audience were be able to influence the light in the concert hall by using their mobile phones (through the website icoe.dk). Emotions are hard to capture and make visible, but what if you make the emotions an active part of the scenography? “In case of emotions” is an interactive system through which the audience can influence the color of the light in the concert hall.
