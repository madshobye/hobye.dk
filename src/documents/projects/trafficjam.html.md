The event was  the first chance to get a glimpse of new technologies and get access to the systems and content that can revolutionize the way we travel. We created new concepts, services, and experiences based on data and tech provided by our partner organizations.

With the help of an infrared camera mounted in the bus and in the train you are able to
count how many passengers there are. You are able to see if there´s any space
left for you and your baby stroller, wheelchair or bike. The webapp suggests the nearest station at hand and gives you a good hint of how much space there is in the next bus or train approaching. Wherever it´s possible the same info is displayed at Skånetrafikens own info screens

It is the simplest travel guide app for commuters. Use it to figure out what time the next train or bus leaves. It only gives you the minutes. It can be used all over the world. It expects you to know the route already.

Users do not start and stop tracking applications when going biking and thus do not track data during most of their rides. Users wants results, not complications. A bluetooth enabled cadence tracker on the bike communicates with an Android phone to track when a biker starts and stops the bike, as well as the position of the bike. This is then presented in a web app displaying the ride on a map and a Google Street View image of each stop.
