abstract: 'We designed two identical boxes with a little lens that was a window into a virtual compass. The needle always points to the other box. Each box had a compartment which was locked with a combination lock. The combination was written on the other box. This meant that you would only be able to discover, what was in the boxes by searching for its twin.'

As an initial experiment the two boxes were placed at two different locations in a park. Two strangers would use the compasses to solve the task of finding each other. After many confusing moments the two participants ended up meeting on a bridge. They managed to open the boxes and inside they found a golden beer and two glasses. They represented the reward and the opportunity to celebrate having solved the task.
