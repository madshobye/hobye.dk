abstract: 'The village is built around the Explosion Tower, which looks like a mix of a derrick and the Eiffel Tower. It is surrounded by luminous stones, and when you make grooves with others on these stones, shooting flames are released from the top of tower out into the sky. '

Explosion Village explored the possibility of creating massive audience participation. The Explosion Village could accommodate two hundred participants, and consisted of water tanks that reacted to drumming. If the participants played fast and enthusiastically together for a certain amount of time, a supersized gas cannon would go off at the top of a centrally placed tower.

The design created interaction cycles with a duration of fifteen minutes each. This happened as a consequence of participants picking up a rhythm. The rhythm would slowly grow in volume and intensity over time. Drumming would “accumulate” energy in the tower. This was depicted visually via ten light bars which lit individually in sequence as the tower moved closer to climax. At climax, the participants would passionately throw their arms in the air and create a loud uproar as the fire went off.
