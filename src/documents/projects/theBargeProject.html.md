abstract: 'The Illutron studio was formed in 2007 by a group of people with a wide range of backgrounds: artists, performers, programmers, electricians, musicians and electronics wizards. The group started with two primary values: to create a community around creative, artistic usage of technology, and to build an open platform where people could explore driven by their own curiosity. You did not have to justify yourself and your work; it was inherent in the culture that somehow, someday your little experiment would find a greater role in an interactive art installation in a gallery or in playful contexts at festivals and events.'

As a physical framing, the collective bought an old rusty industrial barge with 800 square meters of space. The barge was placed in the South Harbour of Copenhagen, and was in stark contrast to the newly built, expensive apartment buildings surrounding it.

The barge served as a messy lab filled with electronic components, steel, and old industrial robots that people had found in scrap yards. The scrap was taken apart, revived and put into new interactive situations. The discarded score display from the national football stadium became an interactive light wall, and an old diving pressure tank became the buffer tank for an interactive fire cannon. All of the experiments were explored by predicting and testing the possibilities they had in a context of playful participants in the field.
