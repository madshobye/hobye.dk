abstract: 'Luca Simeone and I experimented with ways of visualizing the co-authors of Medea. By means of a quick run through of peoples cvÂ´s and a couple of hours of experimentation we were able to create a simple javascript canvas that showed who has been writing papers together.'

The diagram is not an exact representation of the article production within Medea for multiple reasons: Some papers are from before the beginning of Medea, others are not included, and it has not been updated since we made it. It is primarily a quick experiment in understanding ways of navigating data that would normally be overwhelming in its textual form.
