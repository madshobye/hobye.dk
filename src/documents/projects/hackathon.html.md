Connectivity Lab is an experimental prototype arena where skills, technologies and researchers meet with entrepreneurs and companies to help create new and better services, experiences and products in the field of digital media and connected devices. The lab uses virtual/physical prototyping as a method to test and develop new formats, services and products, thereby creating a more efficient and productive collaboration between research resources and the professional and creative industries, start-ups, experts, companies and organisations.

Create new concepts, services, products and experiences with connected devices within 5 explorative themes and 1 creative constraint.
