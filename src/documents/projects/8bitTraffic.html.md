abstract: 'Half Machine and Illutron presented an interactive traffic installation for the opening of Cph ADD (Copenhagen Architecture and Design Days). The antique diode displays ‘listened’ to the traffic around Ørestad Metro station and played along then the trains passed by. Red & green light patterns were triggered by the passing trains and cars on the highway.'

The installation is part of a multiple artists and artist groups event, featuring light art, live music, video installations and great Dj’s. The party is all night in a huge underground space. A former bicycle basement under the subway now opens permanently for art and events, designated to bring culture and music to the new part of Copenhagen city, Ørestaden.
